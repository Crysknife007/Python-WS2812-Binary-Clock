# Python-WS2812-Binary-Clock

Make sure you get the neopixel library from Adafruit before trying to run this.

Pass 9 arguments to clockStrip.py in the form of RGB tuples for the ON, OFF, and DIVIDER state of the leds.

For example: sudo python3 clockStrip.py 50 0 0 5 0 0 15 15 15

Each RGB value can be 0-255.
